## Copernicus  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/btcboost/copernicus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/btcboost/copernicus)

Copernicus is an alternative implementation of the Bitcoin protocol , written in Golang .

Why we would choose to use Go ? This is because Go has the following advantages:

* Multi-platform compilation
* Simple deployment , ditect compilation to promote machine code
* High performance
* Built-in support for high concurrency
* GC
* Rich standard library
* Static type
* Type judgment
* For C support friendly 
* From a project perspective , Go is a well-designed programming language , eg: Code Style , Tool Chain ...
* the code of Go is clean code
* ...

We are developing now , We expect more developers to join the development of Bitcoin , to contribute to the Bitcoin Community .
